Roadmap
-------

This is somewhat tenuous, as I don't like plans except to remind me of things
I might be interested in.  As of right now:

Release 0.2.0: iOS

Goal: Write code on iOS

* Make a cocoapod for gambit (libgambc)
* Make a cocoapod for libffi (?)
* Make a cocoapod for gambit-objc
* Document & automate process of getting gambit running in iOS application

Release 0.3.0: Easiness

Goal: Make it robust and fun to play with.  Take away corner cases.
* Raise decent, descriptive exceptions w/gambit via longjmp()
* Handle OOMs via longjmp()
* Make objc structures == gambit structures?
* Bounds checking when converting to/from structures

Contributing to gambit:

* Makefile
* Can't make a link file if you don't have a source file named after the module
  which is linked last. (Can't load because of undefined symbol.)
  Not even true.  There doesn't seem to be a way to compile and link multiple
  files into a dynamic object.
